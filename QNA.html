        <h2>1. var let const difference:</h2>
        <h4>var:</h4>
        <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.It can be
            declared without initialization.It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is
            “undefined”.hoisting done , with initializing as ‘default’ value</p>
        <h4>Let:</h4>
        <p>hoisting done , with initializing as ‘default’ value.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the
            scope.It can be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it
            will give ‘referenceError’.</p>
        <h4>Const: </h4>
        <p>The scope of a const variable is block scope.It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.It cannot be
            declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared
            without initialization.Hoisting is done, but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access
            the const variable before declaration/initialization</p>

        <h2>2. why should we use template string </h2>
        <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
            variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript.
            It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</p>

        <h2>3. map forEach filter find different: </h2>
        <h4>map()</h4>
        <p>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        </p>
        <h4>forEach()</h4>
        <p>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and
            it returns undefined.</p>
        <h4>filter()</h4>
        <p>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with
            the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
        <h4>find()</h4>
        <p>The find function returns the first item that matches the callback function, or undefined if there is nothing
            that matches.
